  "# Actions tests

  ## Overview
  We test here the different actions that can happen in the app.
  Each action in the app is a record in `reactrails-in-reagent.actions`
  and implements `reactrails-in-reagent.dispatch/Action`.

  At the start the app has the following state:"
  rinr-core/initial-state

  "We can for instance apply the action of changing the way the form is
  displayed"
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-code
    '(dispatch/apply-action rinr-core/initial-state
                            (actions/->SelectFormStyle :stacked)))

  "and get the new value for the app state:"
  (dispatch/apply-action rinr-core/initial-state
                         (actions/->SelectFormStyle :stacked))

  "## Tests"
  )

(deftest switching-form-view
  "We can change the way the form is displayed by changing the `:nav/index` key
  of the global state."

  (testing "At initialisation the nan/index is 0"
    (is (= :horizontal (:nav/index rinr-core/initial-state))))

    (is (= :inline
           (:nav/index (reduce apply-action
                               rinr-core/initial-state
                               [(actions/->SelectFormStyle :stacked)
                                (actions/->SelectFormStyle :inline)]))))))
