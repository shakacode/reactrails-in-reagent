  # The dispatcher in RinR.

  ## A dispatcher intro

  The `reactrails-in-reagent` front end is driven by an event loop similar to
  the one found in [Petrol](https://github.com/krisajenkins/petrol).
  Here is the code for the event loop: "

  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source dispatch/start-dispatcher!)

  "The function has two arities [!app-db] & [!app-db !dispatch-state].
  The job is done in the second arity, the first giving  default value
  for the dispatch state:"

  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source dispatch/!dispatch-state)

  "The `start-dispatcher` fn has in fact two purposes:

  It initializes some dispatch state the loop will need, possibly from a
  previous state.
  This is done by swapping on the !dispatch-state atom with:
  ```clojure
  (swap! !dispatch-state fresh-state dispatch-c)
  ```
  and:"

  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source dispatch/fresh-state)

  "
  It starts a core.async go loop that handles events. This loop does 4 things:

  - First: recovers the channels to listen to. If there aren't any stop looping,
  if there are select one and perfom an iteration
    ```clojure
    (when-let [channels (-> !dispatch-state deref :channels seq)]
      (let [[message channel] (async/alts! channels)]
        ...)
      ...
      (recur))
    ```
  - Second: if the selected channel is closed remove it from the pool of
  pending ones
  ```clojure
  (when (nil? message)
    (remove-closed-channel! !dispatch-state channel))
  ```
  - Third: if the message is implements the `Action` protocol apply the action
  to the app state
  ```clojure
  (when (satisfies? Action message)
    (apply-message-consequence! !app-db message))
  ```
  - Fourth: If the event implements the `EventSource` protocol recovers the
  channels from this event source and place them with the rest of the pending
  channels
  ```clojure
  (when (satisfies? EventSource message)
    (add-event-source! !dispatch-state message))
  ```

  ## The tests")

  test should show no change, the second executed asynchronously should
  see the change."
